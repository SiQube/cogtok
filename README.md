- run *data/get_data.py*
- run *train_models.py* (and optionally also *calculate_derivational_overlap.py*, if you are interested)
- run *analyses/evaluate_with_lexdec_data.py* (and optionally also the other analyses in the directory )

You can also work directly with our already trained models. They can be found in *results/trained/models*. 

The plots from the paper can be found in *results/plots*.
