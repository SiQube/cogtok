# TODO: improve the plots for Figure 1, 2, 3 in the paper

# 1. Read in data from results/results_overview/language_correlations.csv
# --> problem: currently word and non-word results are in the same file, probably easier to copy to separate files before processing
# 2. Combine all results into pandas frame
# --> not sure if that is realistic
# --> need to add a column for category (words, nonwords) and one column for language

# 3. Select categories of interest

# Figure 1: grouped bar plot
# Figure 2: scatter plot with dashed lines
